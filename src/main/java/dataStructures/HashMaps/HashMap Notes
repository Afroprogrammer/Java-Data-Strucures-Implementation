A hashmap is a type of dictionary that use key Value pair to store information also can be called as an
associative array.
//Its a linear Data Structures. it stores information as key value pairs
Its efficient in lookup. Using hashing techniques for storing hash node

Advantages of a hashmap
Faster access to data O(1)

Big O notations of Dictionaries
Accessing - O(1)/ O(n)  //since we also use hash functions we can get O(1) whereas also get 0(n) since we use linked list too
Searching  - O(1)/ O(n)
Deleting - O(1)/ O(n)
Inserting - O(1)/ O(n)
