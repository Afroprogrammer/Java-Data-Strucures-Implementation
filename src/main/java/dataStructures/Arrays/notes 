//Array is linear data structure which stores fixed number of similar elements.
// Array can store primitive data types as well as object but it should be of
// same kind. This is one of most used data structures in java.

//pros of an array
    //You can randomly access array elements using index
    // It can represent multiple elements of same type with single name
    // You can implement various data structures such as LinkedList, Stack and Queue using Array

//Cons of array
//        You need to know number of elements in advance.
//        You can not modify array once its size is defined
//        Insertion and deletion are quite costly operation in array as you need to shift elements.
//         its a waste of memory space if you have an array list which is not filled up

//Big O of arrays
//Accessing - O(1)
//Insertions - O(n)
//Deletions - O(n)
//Searching -  O(n)
