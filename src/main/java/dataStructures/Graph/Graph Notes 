Graph is a non linear Data structure consisting of node and edges
finite set of nodes(Vertices are connected by the edges)

--It has multiple starting points

//Types of Graphs
Undirected Graphs.
  A graph in which the direction you traverse the nodes is not important

  --its usually is not indicated with arrows
  example: facebook friendship network.

Directed Graph
The direction you would traverse the nodes are important
arrows represent how you traverse the nodes.
Example
Friendship network on instagram


********Undirected Graph***********
it can be represented as matrix and represented as a list
in the list representation you can use a nested array for it
for the List representation you can use a linked list to represent


//Other types of graphs are

Cyclic Graph

Acyclic Graph

weighted graph

Unweighted Graph
