Heap Sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm whose functionality is based on the binary heap data structure.
if you are giving an array to represent it as a heap.. you build it by finding the node of the last node that is a leaf
use that node as your heap length and you recursively sort the heap from bottom to top

//Time complexity of a heap
    Best case - O(nlog n);
    Average case - O(nlog n);
    Worst case - O(nlog n);
// Space Complexity
    Worst case - O(1);q

    Heapify takes O(n)
