The popular tree traversals are the inorder, pre-order traversals , post order traversal and BFS or level order
traversals.

In the inorder traversal.. Traversing the tree goes as follows:
LeftNode ==> rootNode ===> Left node

Post order traversal
LeftNode ===> Right Node ===> RootNode

Pre Order Traversal

LeftNode ===> RightNode ===> Root node
these traversals can use the recursion method or use the stack method to represent.
Traversing takes OLog n time ;

To represent a Tree.. in java
We need the Node class that would hold the data and two other Nodes pointing to the left and the right.

Also we would need a tree class to hold all the nodes
