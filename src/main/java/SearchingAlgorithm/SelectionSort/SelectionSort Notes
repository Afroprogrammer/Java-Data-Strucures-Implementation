//Selection Sort
its an in-place comparison based unstable algorithm which is used to sort an unsorted list to a sorted list

Big O for selection sort

Time complexity -  Best case - 0(n^2)
                   Average  case - 0(n^2)
                   worst case - 0(n^2)

 Space -     Worst case 0(1)

 //Applications
 since it has a bad space complexity, it is not used in the computer science community that much
 it is used for small applications with  less memory space for use
