//Bubble Sort

its a simple in-place, comparison based stable sorting algorithm which repeatedly steps through and unsorted list
compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in a wrong order.

//Time Space Complexity of Bubble sort

Best case  - O(n)  -- when the list given is already sorted

Worst case - O(n^2)

Average case -  O(n^2)

Space Complexity - 0(1)

//Use cases

Its generically a bad sorting algorithm and should not be used in computer science because it use nested loops
-Its used for teaching
-For error checking in computer science
