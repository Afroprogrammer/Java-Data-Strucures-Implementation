//Merge Sort

it is a stable comparison based recursive, divide and conquer algorithom which repeatedly
breaks down a list of elements into smaller and smaller parts then slowly puts it together
in a sorted manner,

//Big O notations

//time complexities
Best case - O(nlogn)
Average case - O(nlogn)
Worst case - O(nlogn)

Space complexity O(n) it would create space for each element in the array
